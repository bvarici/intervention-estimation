# Scalable Intervention Target Estimation in Linear Models
Implementation of the algorithm of the paper Scalable Intervention Target Estimation in Linear Models (NeurIPS 2021), and the code to generate simulation results.

Required packages:
causaldag
networkx
matplotlib

run example.py file to generate our algorithm vs. UTIGSP figures on Dixit dataset (Fig.2b of the paper).
example.ipynb contains more explanation regarding hyperparameters and runs the example.py experiment.
